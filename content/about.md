Hi, my name is Simon Korzunov, I'm passionate about programming and coffee.

I used to be a game developer and [Magic: the Gathering](http://magic.wizards.com/en) player.

I worked on (in that order):

* game: [Rig'n'Roll](http://www.rignroll.com/).
* [Active Reports](http://activereports.grapecity.com/).
* game: [PrimeWorld](http://en.playpw.com/)
* currently working on [Office 365](https://products.office.com/en-us/home)
* and many more.
