I was going to start a blog since 2010. Just six years later here I come.  

There were a couple of reasons why I didn't do it(besides being lazy).  

1) I'm not as fluent in English as I would like. Now I work for Microsoft and live in the Seattle area. So I kinda have to improve myself on this front somehow. So please bear with me.  

2) I think I do possess enough knowledge and thoughts to make it interesting to read. But... where do I start? How do I form a flow for my blog? Should there be a theme of some sort?  

So here is a short summary of what this blog is about to be (although no promises, I keep the right to change it anytime!).  

The thing I'm passionate about the most is programming. I started to help my brother write Tetris in 1993 (or somewhere around that era). I was a 7 year old kiddo. But the true passion came to me only in 1999 when I was in High School. I was playing Baldur's Gate like 55 hours a week, when a sudden realization came to me: "I want to make games".  

And now (just 17 years later) I work for Microsoft. Funny enough, currently I'm working on mail flow transport in O365 (almost game development, I know).  

But the passion somehow transformed into this: "I want to make the best code possible. I want to be proud of my work when I go home". So, in this blog I want to focus on how to write the best possible code. Because this is the thing I care about the most. If I spend around 8 hours a day at work, I want to be sure that I'm spending them on something worthy.  

Being a game developer (back in the days) taught me something unique:  

**Developers are mere tools for people to make something great. **Think about it this way: GitHub exists because a lot of amazing developers decided to use it for their projects; games are great because of game designers (and of course not because of programmers); Photoshop exists because of artists; Slack exists because it's a great tool for team collaboration, etc.  

I think we (developers) exist to make somebody else's life easier. This is a little bit extreme, but we need to keep our ego (which is usually quite a thing) under control to make our own lives easier.  

I'm about to start an open source project on GitHub focused on visual programming. I want to make a tool that will allow people to formulate their thoughts in a visual form. And I would like to share my development process of the project (but not only) in this blog.  

 There are a lot of tools like that. And the idea was around since 1980 (I guess). So what makes me think that my idea is worth a shot? I want to provide an"exclusive" user experience: think first, programming later. That's it, let the people think of what they want and visualize it. And a developer would pick up a visualization, generate code based on it and implement the "logic blocks", but not the whole thinking process.  

At the moment I haven't created a repository yet, but I do have a simple prototype that I like a lot. And I'm going to talk about it in my next post.
